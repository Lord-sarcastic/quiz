# backend
A web application for creating and taking quizzes online
## How to use
### Requirements:
- Docker and Docker Compose


### Begin
#### Running the application
- Clone the repo
- `cd` into the repo
- Duplicate the file named ".env.example", rename the new copy to ".env" within the same directory. You can edit the values there as you want save for the `POSTGRES_HOST` and `POSTGRES_PORT` which I do not recommend except you know what you are doing.
- Perform migrations with `docker-compose run web python manage.py migrate`
- Create your superuser account with `docker-compose run web python manage.py createsuperuser`. Fill in required details. Note that your password won't display on the screen. Type blindly and trust the god of Django to log it in.
- To start the server, run `docker-compose up`
- You can start making requests by visiting [http://localhost:10000](http://localhost:10000)

## To do
This section contains uncompleted features for the application
- Constraints on number of questions per quiz: Maximum number of questions for a quiz is meant to be 10
- Quiz taken by user: A user should be able to access the list of quizzes that they have taken and view the results
- More tests: The test section of the application is not as comprehensive and needs more work
